        <h3>An Ideal Husband</h3>

        <h5>Third ACT :_The Library of Lord Goring’s House in Curzon Street_</h5>

        <p>
            <h6 class="name PHIPPS">PHIPPS.</h6>  <p class="Speech">Yes, my lord.</p>  <p class="Stage-direction">[_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
            presents new buttonhole on salver_.]</p>

            <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="Speech">Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
            of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.</p> 

            <h6 class="name PHIPPS">PHIPPS.</h6> <p class="Speech"> Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.</p>

            <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class="Stage-direction">[_Taking out old buttonhole_.] </p>   <p class="Speech">You see, Phipps, Fashion is
            what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.</p>

            <h6 class="name PHIPPS">PHIPPS.</h6>  <p class="Speech">Yes, my lord.</p>

            <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="Speech">Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.</p>

            <h6 class="name PHIPPS">PHIPPS.</h6>  <p class="Speech">Yes, my lord.</p>

            <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="Stage-direction">[_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]</p> <p class="Speech"> And falsehoods the truths
            of other people.</p>

           <h6 class="name PHIPPS"> PHIPPS.</h6>  <p class="Speech">Yes, my lord.</p>

            <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="Speech">Other people are quite dreadful.  The only possible society
            is oneself.</p>

            <h6 class="name PHIPPS">PHIPPS.</h6> <p class="Speech"> Yes, my lord.</p>

            <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="Speech">To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
            Phipps.</p>

            <h6 class="name PHIPPS">PHIPPS.</h6>  <p class="Speech">Yes, my lord.</p>

            <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="Stage-direction">[_Looking at himself in the glass_.]</p>  <p class="Speech">Don’t think I quite
            like this buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me
            almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?</p>

            <h6 class="name PHIPPS">PHIPPS.</h6>  <p class="Speech">I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.</p>

            <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="Speech">You don’t, Phipps?</p>

            <h6 class="name PHIPPS">PHIPPS.</h6>  <p class="Speech">No, my lord.</p>

            <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="Speech">I am not quite sure.  For the future a more trivial
            buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.</p>
