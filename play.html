        <h3>An Ideal Husband</h3>

        <h5>Third ACT :_The Library of Lord Goring’s House in Curzon Street_</h5>

        <p>
            <h6>PHIPPS.</h6>  <p>Yes, my lord.</p>  <p>[_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
            presents new buttonhole on salver_.]</p>

            <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
            of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.</p> 

            <h6>PHIPPS.</h6> <p> Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.</p>

            <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p>[_Taking out old buttonhole_.] </p>   <p>You see, Phipps, Fashion is
            what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.</p>

            <h6>PHIPPS.</h6>  <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

            <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.</p>

            <h6>PHIPPS.</h6>  <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

            <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>[_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]</p> <p> And falsehoods the truths
            of other people.</p>

           <h6> PHIPPS.</h6>  <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

            <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>Other people are quite dreadful.  The only possible society
            is oneself.</p>

            <h6>PHIPPS.</h6> <p> Yes, my lord.</p>

            <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
            Phipps.</p>

            <h6>PHIPPS.</h6>  <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

            <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>[_Looking at himself in the glass_.]</p>  <p>Don’t think I quite
            like this buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me
            almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?</p>

            <h6>PHIPPS.</h6>  <p>I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.</p>

            <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>You don’t, Phipps?</p>

            <h6>PHIPPS.</h6>  <p>No, my lord.</p>

            <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>I am not quite sure.  For the future a more trivial
            buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.</p>
