        <h3>An Ideal Husband</h3>

        <h5>Third ACT :_The Library of Lord Goring’s House in Curzon Street_</h5>

        <p>
            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
            presents new buttonhole on salver_.]<br>

            LORD GORING.  Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
            of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.<br>

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.<br>

            LORD GORING.  [_Taking out old buttonhole_.]  You see, Phipps, Fashion is
            what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.<br>

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.<br>

            LORD GORING.  Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.<br>

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.<br>

            LORD GORING.  [_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]  And falsehoods the truths
            of other people.<br>

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.<br>

            LORD GORING.  Other people are quite dreadful.  The only possible society
            is oneself.<br>

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.<br>

            LORD GORING.  To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
            Phipps.<br>

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.<br>

            LORD GORING.  [_Looking at himself in the glass_.]  Don’t think I quite
            like this buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me
            almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?<br>

            PHIPPS.  I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.<br>

            LORD GORING.  You don’t, Phipps?<br>

            PHIPPS.  No, my lord.<br>

            LORD GORING.  I am not quite sure.  For the future a more trivial
            buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.<br>
